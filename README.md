# HTML Slides

This project aims to **make it easier for HTML-capable authors to craft a slide deck** as visual aid for a spoken presentation, by leveraging the power of HTML, JS and CSS. In addition to the opinionated core functionality and design, the full power of HTML, JS and CSS is at the author's fingertips.

The preferred workflow is that an author _only_ composes semantic HTML for their presentation's content. Sensible default JavaScript code and CSS styling is then applied to e.g. highlight and trigger animations in an orderly and - for the audience - focused fashion as they follow the presentation.
