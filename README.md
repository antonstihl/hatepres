# HTML Slides

This project aims to ease the challenging activity of crafting a slide deck as visual aid for a spoken presentation, by leveraging the power of HTML, JS and CSS.

Have a look at (and inspect) this page to see HTML-slides in action: https://antonstihl.github.io/html-slides/

The preferred workflow is that an author _only_ composes semantic HTML for their presentation's content.

Sensible default JavaScript code and CSS styling is then applied to e.g. highlight and trigger animations in an orderly and - for the audience - focused fashion as they follow the presentation.

This is all very opinionated, which should enable any HTML-capable author to easily make a clean and enjoyable visual aid for their presentation. In addition to the core functionality and design, the full power of HTML, JS and CSS is at the author's fingertips.
